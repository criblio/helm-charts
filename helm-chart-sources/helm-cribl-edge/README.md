# Edge Helm Chart

This chart deploys a Cribl Edge DaemonSet in a Kubernetes Cluster.

# Deployment

As built, this chart will deploy a DaemonSet on all Nodes in a K8s cluster, Service Account, Cluster Role, Cluster Role Binding, and Secret for setting the Cribl Leader configuration.

When deploying this chart, you must change the Fleet API host from binding on `127.0.0.1` to `0.0.0.0`. If you do not, health checks will fail and the Pods will be continually replaced.

**Note**: This chart does **not** deploy a Cribl Leader node!

# Prerequisites

1. Helm v3 installed â€“ instructions are [here](https://helm.sh/docs/intro/install/).
2. Cribl helm repo configured. To do this:
    `helm repo add cribl https://criblio.github.io/helm-charts/`

# Known Issues

* This chart is not deployable on EKS Fargate. See [AWS Fargate considerations](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/eks/latest/userguide/fargate.html#fargate-considerations) for more information.

# More Info

For additional documentation about this chart, see the [Cribl Docs](https://docs.cribl.io/edge/deploy-running-kubernetes) page.
