# logstream-workergroup Helm Chart

This chart deploys a Cribl Stream worker group.

# IMPORTANT
Versions starting with 3.4.0 include a change to the syntax for RBAC values. Before you upgrade the chart from pre-3.4.0 versions, please see the [table below](#values) for current options for the `rbac.apiGroups`, `rbac.verbs`, and `rbac.resources` values.

# New Capabilities
* Support for the 3.5.4 version of Cribl Stream (default version)

# Deployment

As built, this chart will deploy a simple worker group for Cribl Stream, consisting of a deployment, a service, and a horizontal pod autoscaler config, as well as a secret used for configuration. 

This chart does **not** deploy a leader node – it depends on that node's already being present.

# Prerequisites

1. Helm (preferably v3) installed – instructions are [here](https://helm.sh/docs/intro/install/).
1. Cribl helm repo configured. To do this:
	`helm repo add cribl https://criblio.github.io/helm-charts/`

### A Note About Versioning

We recommend that you use the same version of the Cribl Stream code on leader nodes and workergroup nodes. 

# Install


* To  install the chart with the release name "logstream-wg":

 `helm install logstream-wg cribl/logstream-workergroup`

* To install the chart using the logstream leader 'logstream.lab.cribl.io'

 `helm install logstream-wg cribl/logstream-workergroup --set config.host='logstream.lab.cribl.io`

* To install the chart using the logstream leader 'logstream.lab.cribl.io' in the namespace "cribl-helm"

 `helm install logstream-wg cribl/logstream-workergroup --set config.host='logstream.lab.cribl.io' -n cribl-helm`
 
# Upgrading

This is done simply using the `helm upgrade` command. It's important to ensure that your Helm repository cache is up to date, so the first command is:

```
helm repo update
```

After this step, invoke `helm upgrade <release> -n <namespace> cribl/logstream-workergroup`. For the example above, where the release is "logstream-wg" and is installed in the "cribl-helm" namespace, the command would be:

```
helm upgrade logstream-wg -n cribl-helm cribl/logstream-workergroup
```

This helm chart's upgrade is idempotent, so you can use the upgrade mechanism to upgrade, but can also use it as displayed [below](#changing) for changing its configuration. 
 
# Optional: Kubernetes API Access

Versions 2.4.0+ include access mechanisms for worker groups to access the Kubernetes API. Four options are available in the `values.yaml` file for this:

* `rbac.create` – enables the creation of a Service Account, Cluster Role, and Role Binding (which binds the first two together) for the release.
* `rbac.resources` – specifies the Kubernetes API resources that will be available to the release.
* `rbac.verbs` – specifies the API verbs that will be available to the release.
* `rbac.extraRules` – additional rulesets for the cluster role.

For more info on the verbs and resources available, see the [Kubernetes documentation](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/access-authn-authz/rbac/). 

# <span id="changing"> Changing Configuration </span>

Once you have an installed release, you can get the `values.yaml` file from it by using the `helm get values` command. For example, with the release name "logstream-wg", the command line would look like this:

```
helm get values logstream-wg -o yaml > values.yaml
```

This will create a `values.yaml` file with the values in the running release, including any overridden values that you specified when installed. You can make changes to that file, and then use the `helm upgrade` operation to "upgrade" the release with the new configuration.

For example, if you want to add an additional TCP-based syslog port to the release, to listen on port 5141 to the "logstream-wg" release, you'd add:

```
  – name: syslog
    port: 5141
    protocol: TCP
```

...to the `values.yaml` file's `service` > `ports` subsection, and then run:

```
helm upgrade logstream-wg cribl/logstream-workergroup -f values.yaml
```

Remember, if you installed in a namespace, you need to include the `-n <namespace>` option to any `helm` command. You'll still have to create the source in your Cribl Stream leader, and commit and deploy it to your worker group.

# Using Persistent Storage for Persistent Queueing

With the addition of the `extraVolumeMounts` capability, it is now feasible to use persistent volumes for Cribl Stream persistent queueing. However there is variability in persistent-storage implementations, and this variability can lead to problems in scaling workergroups, and we recommend only implementing this if you have confidence in your persistent storage implementations. If you choose to implement persistent volumes for queueing, please consider these suggestions:

1. Use a shared-storage-volume mechanism. We've worked with the EFS CSI driver for AWS, and it works fairly well (though it can be a little tedious to configure).
2. Understand your Kubernetes networking topology, and how it interacts with your persistent storage driver. (For example, if you're in AWS, ensure that your volumes are available in all Availability Zones that your nodes might run in.) 
3. Monitor the workergroup pods for volume issues. The faster you can see such issues and react, the more likely that you'll be able to resolve them.

# Known Issues

* The chart currently supports *only* TCP ports on the worker group services. This may be addressed in future versions.
* [EKS-Specific Issues](../../common_docs/EKS_SPECIFICS.md).
